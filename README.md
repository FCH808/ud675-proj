Files
-----
* scikit-example.py - Start here. This shows you how to use the scikit-learn library to learn a decision tree model.
* complexity/ - Model complexity experiments for DT, NN, kNN, SVM and Boosting. For each algorithm, we change various complexity parameters and test algorithm performance against a test set.
* learning_curves/ - Learning curves for DT, NN, kNN, SVM and Boosting. For each algorithm, we observe the performance when we change the input sample size.
