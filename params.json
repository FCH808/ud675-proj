{"name":"ud675 Final Project","tagline":"Supervised Learning","body":"ud675 Final Project\r\n==========\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou will need Python version 2.7.5 or up to get started. To install sci-kit follow [sci-kit Installation Docs][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles\r\n-----\r\n* scikit-example.py - Start here. This shows you how to use the scikit-learn library to learn a decision tree model.\r\n* complexity/ - Model complexity experiments for DT, NN, kNN, SVM and Boosting. For each algorithm, we change various complexity parameters and test algorithm performance against a test set.\r\n* learning_curves/ - Learning curves for DT, NN, kNN, SVM and Boosting. For each algorithm, we observe the performance when we change the input sample size.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Fork it.\r\n2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my_branch`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am \"Awesome feature\"`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_branch`)\r\n5. Open a [Pull Request][1]\r\n6. Enjoy a refreshing Diet Coke and wait \r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n* [sci-kit Reference Docs][2]\r\n* [sci-kit Installation Docs][3]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests\r\n[2]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html\r\n[3]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
